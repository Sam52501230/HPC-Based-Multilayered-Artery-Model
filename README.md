# HPC-Based Multilayered Artery Model

A Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation of blood flow in multi-layered arterial models using COMSOL Multiphysics with Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI).

## üìã Project Overview

This project implements a high-performance computing (HPC) based simulation framework for analyzing blood flow dynamics in anatomically accurate multi-layered arterial structures. The model incorporates three distinct arterial layers (intima, media, adventitia) with hyperelastic material properties using the Holzapfel-Gasser-Ogden (HGO) model.
